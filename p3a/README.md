At first, we started out the project by implementing quicksort, but realized that our implementation was too costly in terms of performance. Because of this, we switched over to a concurrent merge sorting algorithm. This algorithm follows the classic principles of merge sort, but uses concurrency to speed up the runtime with worker threads being assigned merge sorting when they are available.
